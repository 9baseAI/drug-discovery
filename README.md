# 🧠 Research Assistant for Drug Discovery — An AI-Powered System for Scientific Insight

The **Research Assistant for Drug Discovery** is a conceptual AI system designed to support pharmaceutical research and development by combining scientific reasoning, knowledge retrieval, and predictive analysis. Acting as a virtual researcher, the assistant helps scientists analyze complex biomedical questions, retrieve relevant data, and predict drug-like properties of compounds with precision.

## 🎯 Project Objective

This system aims to accelerate the drug discovery process by:

- Breaking down complex research questions into manageable scientific sub-tasks
- Synthesizing accurate and relevant knowledge from scientific literature
- Predicting critical pharmacokinetic and toxicity parameters (ADMET)
- Delivering structured, evidence-based recommendations for R&D decision-making

## 🧩 How the Assistant Works

The assistant consists of multiple intelligent agents, each simulating a phase of scientific inquiry. These agents collaborate to analyze user questions, gather information, run predictions, and generate concise, technically sound responses.

### 🔍 Smart Question Understanding
The assistant first interprets the user's question, identifying key areas such as chemical structure, biological mechanisms, or research methodology.

### 📚 Scientific Knowledge Retrieval
Relevant information is retrieved from a scientific document database using semantic similarity and domain-specific embeddings.

### 🧪 Knowledge Synthesis
The retrieved content is synthesized into structured scientific knowledge, using advanced prompt techniques aligned with medicinal chemistry and drug development workflows.

### 🧬 ADMET Property Prediction
The assistant evaluates drug-likeness based on molecular structure (e.g., SMILES strings), predicting properties such as solubility, toxicity, metabolism, and bioavailability.

### 🧠 Integrated Scientific Response
All gathered insights are combined into a clear, actionable report — guiding further research or development strategies.
